Solution -

Given: 6X + 3Y = 105;
Given: 2X + 8Y = 84;

2X = 84 - 8Y;

Lets Put X value into first equation
- 84 - 8Y + 84 - 8Y + 84 - 8Y + 3Y = 105;
-24Y + 3Y + 252 = 105;
-21Y = 105 - 252;
-21Y = - 147;
Y = 147 / 21 = 7
breakfast = 7

meal > 6X + 21 = 105
    > 6X = 84
meal > X = 14


6X + 4Y >> 6 * 14 + 4 * 7
    = 84 + 28
    = 112;
112 / 2 = 56

2 * 14 + 4 * 7
28 + 28 = 56

42 + 14 = 56;

14 + 35 = 49 // Correct Answer. (One dinner meal and five breakfast meals)

* In a singing contest there are 16 singers, each has to sing a duet with each of the other singers. If the contest is 4 days long, and there is an equal number of duets performed on each day, how many duets will be performed every day?

Solution -

total 16 singers
1 will sing duet with > 15 other singers
2 > 14
3 > 13
14 > 2
15 > 1
16 > all done;

total rounds > 1 to 15 add all numbers
sum of 1 to 5 > 15
sum of 6 to 10 > 40
sum of 11 to 15 = 65.
sum of 1 to 15 = 120.

120 rounds in 4 days as given in question.
So 30 rounds in one day. (answer)

Find the odd one out:
EGK
HJN
BDH
OQT

ANSWER > OQT.

EGK > G comes after 2 chars from E (includeing E). K comes after 4 chars after G.
So this pattern in not fit in last option.

Series >
8, 10, 13, 18, 25, ?
ANS - 36

8 + 2 = 10 + 0 = 10
10 + 2 = 12 + 1 = 13
13 + 3 = 16 + 2 = 18
18 + 4 = 22 + 3 = 25
25 + 5 = 30
