/*
Dynamic Programming is an approach to solve problems by dividing the main complex problem int smaller parts, and then using these to build up the final solution.
In dynamic programming, we store the results of smaller sub-problems so that we do not need to re-compute the result for the same sub-problem. As we store the results of smaller sub-problems, the idea is to replace the repeated recursive calls with the stored result whenever we encounter an already solved sub-problem.

? Prefix sum technique also works on same idea to use previous result. (But keep in mind that PF is not DP)
> In Prefix sum we use previous result to calculate new result.

Arr     =       [1, 2, 3, 4]
PF      =       [1, 3, 6, 10]

Formula is => PF[i] = PF[i-1] + A[i];

* Recursion is a prerequisite for Dynamic Programming.
* Dynamic programming can reduce the time needed to perform a recursive algorithm.

*/



/*
* To understand Dynamic Programming more clearly, let us look at an example.

! Example of Fibonacci Series

Suppose we want to reconstruct the Fibonacci Series. It is a series, which starts with 0 and 1, and each consecutive term is the sum of the previous two terms in the series.

Fibonacci Series are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....

Fib(n) = Fin(n-1) + Fib(n-2);

Below two are base cases-

Fib(0) = 0
Fib(1) = 1
*/

//@ Fibonacci series with Recursion

function fibSeries(n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fibSeries(n - 1) + fibSeries(n - 2);   //Recursive Call
}

//? Time Complexity is O(2^n) and SC = O(n)

/*
At level 0  => Fib(n)                                       2^0
At level 1  => Fib(n-1)              Fib(n-2)               2^1
At level 2  => Fib(n-2) Fib(n-3)    Fib(n-3) Fib(n-4)       2^2


* We can see here that there are some sub problems which we are solving over and over that we can solve with dp.

Now if we look at the dynamic Programming approach, instead of recomputing these repeating terms again, we will just store them and use the pre-calculated values, making the solution much more efficient.


! Every Recursive problem is not DP problem ??

? There are two things required for DP problem.

1. Answer of current problem can be formed with answers of sub problems.
2. Same sub problems is calculated multiple times.

*/

/*
* Characteristics of Dynamic Programming

Two very important characteristics essential for a Dynamic Programming approach to work are:

Optimal Substructure - Answer of current problem can be formed with answers of sub problems. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Overlapping Sub problems -  Same sub problems is calculated multiple times.
*/

// Top down approach
function fibSeriesWithDP(n) {
    console.log('fibSeriesWithDP :', n);
    let arr = [0, 1]; // initial two values we know that is 0 and 1.
    run(n);
    function run(n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return n;
        }

            return arr[n];

        arr[n] = run(n - 1) + run(n - 2);
        return arr[n];
    }
    return arr;
}

// TC = O(n)
// SC = O(n + n) => buffer array + call stack => O(n)

//! Approaches to Dynamic Programming

/*

There are two types of approach that can be used to solve a problem by Dynamic Programming:

* Memoization or Top-Down Dynamic Programming or Recursive DP
* Tabulation or Bottom Up Dynamic Programming or Iterative DP


! Top-Down

we start from the most complex problem and move to sub problems. So, in this fashion, we keep moving downwards until we reach the base cases. For example, in the Fibonacci series, the base case is for the first and second term, which will be 0 and 1 respectively.
On the way, we keep storing the values of all the sub problems which are computed so they can be reused. This process of storing the values of sub problems is called Memoization.
Above solution was top-down to find Fibonacci series.

! Bottom Up

As the name suggests, to find out the solution to a problem we start from the base cases, moving up towards more complex and larger sub problems until we reach the solution we need to find.
So, in this fashion, we keep moving upwards until we reach the desired state.  On the way, we keep storing the values of all the sub problems in a table sequentially. If needed, these values are accessed directly from the table.

    console.log('fibSeriesWithBottomUPApproach :', n);

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        F[i] = F[i - 1] + F[i - 2];
    }
    return F; // If you want nth item then simply return F[n]
}

console.log(fibSeriesWithBottomUPApproach(5)) // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
console.log(fibSeriesWithBottomUPApproach(7)) //[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

// TC  = O(n) and SC = O(n) :: Sometimes it possible to optimize SC to O(1) in Iterative approach

- 2nd way : Ground -> B -> C
- 3nd way : Ground -> A -> C

? Stairs = [1, 2, 3, ........, n-3, n-2, n-1, n];

- We can reach to n only from 2 stairs and that are n-2 and n-1;
- Suppose X is number of ways to reach n-2;
- Suppose Y is number of ways to reach n-1;

#ways(N) = #ways(n-1) + #ways(n-2);    => X + Y

@ Little confused how X + Y ?

Reaching on n-2 has X ways and If we take 2 more steps then we can reach to N; So here we are adding steps but way are same and that is X;
Same as n-1. If we take one more step then we can reach to N, So here also way are same and that is Y;
SO total is X + Y;

* Please keep in mind that we have to find number of ways, not number of steps;
Example - If there are 1000 stairs and we are climbing one one stair then it will be only 1 way.

@ Understand approach-

N = 4   => 2^2 ||   (1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) so min count is 1 because in second way there are 4 counts;

N = 50  => 7^2 + 1^2 OR 5^2 + 5^2  both are possible ways. ans = 2;

N = 12;

? Lets try to find out min count with Greedy approach =>
- Greedy says choose best result at a time.

Nearest perfect square of 12 is 9 => 3^2

12 - 3^2 = 3

Now we have remaining 3. So nearest perfect square of 3 is 1.

3 - 1^2 =  2

Now 2 is remaining. Nearest perfect Square of 2 is again 1.

2 - 1^2 = 1

Now 1 is remaining. Nearest perfect Square of 1 is again 1.

1 - 1^2 = 0.

:: So total count 4.(With above greedy approach)

* While 12 => 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 12    :: so total count is 3.

So here greedy approach did not give min count. We have to check all possible solutions.

//! Ways to Decode


/*
@ Approach

S = '1'

- From String of length 1, possible ways to decode is 1.

S = '12';

- Can 2 Chars give an decode value? YES
    - If value is less then or equal to 26. Like decode value of 25 is Y and decode value of 26 is Z.

- 12 is of length 2, and we know that by single length of string, there is one way.
    - (1, 2) is one way => Decode value is AB
    - 12 is also a valid value so that is 2nd way. 12 => L
    - So total ways are 2.

- Now we know that for single char, ways are 1 and for 2 chars ways are 2. So we can store these values into an array or called dp array based on length.

dp[1] = 1;  // means for length 1, only 1 way is there.
dp[2] = 2; //  There are 2 ways for string '12'. (length is 2)

But If string is '79' then dp[2] = 1; :: Because 79 cannot be decoded.

S = '123';
    - (1, 2, 3) is one way.
    - (12, 3) is second way.
    - (1, 23) is third way.

S = '1234'; -- ways are 3.
     - (1, 2, 3, 4)
     - (12, 3, 4)
     - (1, 23, 4)
