 If there are 100 different species, we will need to implement 100 if-else cases. So what!? We
have many if-elses. Why is that a problem?

‚ùì Readable Yes. I can read & understand it. But actually no! As the number of species
grows, the complexity is growing as well - becomes harder to read and understand

‚ùì Testable Seems like it. I can write a testcase for each species. However, the test cases
and the code is coupled - changing code for one species will effect the behavior of other
species - nightmare to correctly test

‚ùì Extensible Yes. If a new species gets added tomorrow - all I have to do is add a new ifelse condition. More on this later.

‚ùì Maintainable If there are multiple devs working on different species, will there be any
issues? Common issue - Merge Conflicts

Readable We have a lot of classes/files now - readability is poor - But Let's look at

bheavior of other.

// üê¶ Desing a Bird Library

// [ Library: Bird ]
class Birds extends AnimalBase {
  // species inherited from the parent class AnimalBase
  bird: string = '';

  fly() {
    if (this.bird === 'peacocks') {
      console.log('I can cover short distances only by flying.');
    } else if (this.bird === 'Penguins') {
      console.log('I am a bird but cannot fly.');
    } else if (this.bird === 'Crow') {
      console.log('I can fly high.');
    } else {
      console.log('No idea..');
    }
  }
}

// To use this Bird Library, we can import this library into out code..
// import Birds from 'BirdLibrary';

/**
 üíé PROBLEM WITH ABOVE LIBRARY -

 1. Not extendable -  I want to "extend" this Bird functionality in my code to add a new bird but can not do.
 2. This library will be available as compiled code so can not modify this.
 */

// Lets solve above problem with Open close principle.

// ‚≠ê Open/Close Principle ‚≠ê

/* Your code should be closed for modification, however, it should still be open for
extension! */

/*
‚ùî Why is modifying existing code bad?

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Let'see How does code development cycle work in big comapanies...

Step 1 - Developer write code. And test in on own machine.
Step 2 - Send to QA team for testing. - Manual testing, regression testing, integration testing etc..
Step 3 - If all testing well then deployment cycle starts
Step 4 - Deployment Cycle -
            1. Deployed code on Staging server to test changes.
            2. If all well from 1 then deploy to Prod server but only for few users (5% users), not for every one.
            3. Monitor changes, feedbacks and errors for 5% users. Test code for those.
            4. Once all well, then finally deployed for all users.
*/

// So its a very big process to deploy changes, If we modify in existing code..
// Other teams also use same library, so modification can break other projects functionalities as well.

abstract class Birds1 extends AnimalBase {
  // species inherited from the parent class AnimalBase
  bird: string = '';

  abstract fly(); // This is abstract method so cannot implement this here..
}

// Concrete class - A class which extends abstract class.

class Peacocks extends Birds1 {
  fly(): void {
    console.log('I can cover short distances only by flying.');
  }
}
class Duck extends Birds1 {
  fly(): void {
    console.log('Generally don\'t fly. I found in places where there is water like ponds, rivers');
  }
}

/**
Modification. Closed for modification
Extension - Yes, Now we can add fly method as per our need in client code.
 */

// ‚ùì Didn't we make the exact same change for both Single Responsibility & Open Close?

// Yes, we did! In both cases we converted the if-else ladder to class inheritance.

/**
 ‚úîÔ∏è Is the SRP == Open/Close Principle? No. The solution was same, but the intention was different.
üîó The SOLID principles are inherently linked together.
 */

// ‚úã Analogy: if you speak the truth, you're being honest. If you're being honest, you're obviously
// speaking the truth.

// ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Let's see problem with above code --

// üòí Kiwi or Penguin cannot fly but still It needs to implement fly method because that is abstract.

class Kiwi extends Birds1 {
  // Concrete class
  fly() {
    // this is unused here..
  }
}
//üëÄ If we don't implement fly method, we will get compile error because of abstract.

// abstract -  Abstract class says that you can do something (like Bird can fly), ok, but How you can do thatone,
// it need to tell in child class.

// üíª Lets throw some exception from fly method

class Kiwi1 extends Birds1 {
  // Concreate class
  fly() {
    throw new Error('Kiwi dont fly'); // throw exception.
  }
}

// Run typescript code  - https://www.typescriptlang.org/play

// Run below class - That is before extension.
class Main {
  main() {
    var birdObj = new Birds();
    birdObj.bird = 'peacocks'; // it is User choice.
    birdObj.fly();
    birdObj.bird = 'kiwi';
    birdObj.fly();
  }
}

const mainObj = new Main();
mainObj.main();
// [LOG]: "I can cover short distances only by flying."
// [LOG]: "No idea.."

// Before extension , above code is working fine as we have all if else in one place.
// But after extension, Kiwi throws error so code will get error. It could be the case that throwing exception could break someone's code.

// Lets solve above problem of exception and error --

// ‚≠ê Liskov Substitution Principle

/**

1. Any functionality in the parent class must also work for the child class

2. If some piece of code works with a parent class P, then it should continue working,
without modifications, with any child class C extends P

3. Any extension to existing code should not break existing code / violate expectations

*/

// üé® How should we re-design it?

abstract class Bird2 extends AnimalBase {
  // species inherited from AnimalBase
  bird: string = '';

  // every bird can speak or eat so put these method here..
  speak() {}
  eat() {}

  // don'\t define abstract method here like fly or swim etc...
}

// Create Interface for Fly

interface IFly {
  fly(): void;
}

// Now We know Eagle can fly so implement IFly interface

class Eagle extends Bird2 implements IFly {
  fly() {
    // fly
  }
}

// As Dodo bird cannot fly so no need to implement IFly interface here.
// no compile error

class Dudo extends Bird2 {}

// Lets create another interface ICanFly

interface ICanFly {
  flapWings(): void;
  kickOffGroundToTakeOff(): void;
  fly(): void;
}

class Shaktiman implements ICanFly {
  flapWings() {} // Shaktiman dont have wings so this method is unused here
  fly() {
    console.log('With one hand up, Shaktimaan spines & then fly away');
  }
  kickOffGroundToTakeOff() {}
}

class Airplane implements ICanFly {
  flapWings(): void {} // unused method implementation because Airplane does not flap wings
  fly(): void {
    console.log('I can fly');
  }
  kickOffGroundToTakeOff(): void {
    console.log('ready for take off..');
  }
}

/** PROBLEM IN ABOVE CODE -

 Classes implement interface thats why It required to implement all its methods either class needs it or not.

*/

// ‚≠ê Interface Segregation Principle ‚≠ê

/**
1. Keep your interfaces minimal
2. No code should be forced to implement a method that it does not need.

To fix the previous code, we can split the ICanFly interface into multiple interfaces

 * 1. Bars (‡§∏‡§≤‡§æ‡§ñ‡•ã‡§Ç)> Wooden , Iron  bars, small bars
 * 2. Feeding Bowl - Fruits, water, meat.
 * 3. size - height , width
 */

// Lets first create interface and classes for above properties.

interface IBars {}
class WoodenBars implements IBars {}
class IronBars implements IBars {}
class SmallGapBars implements IBars {}

interface IFeedingBowl {}
class MeatFeedingBowl implements IFeedingBowl {}
class FruitFeedingBowl implements IFeedingBowl {}
class WaterFeedingBowl implements IFeedingBowl {}

interface ISize {}
class CageSize implements ISize {}

// herbivorous animals - ‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§µ‡§∞

class CarnivorousCage {
  meetFeedingBowl: MeatFeedingBowl;
  waterBowl: WaterFeedingBowl;
  ironBars: IronBars;
  smallGapBars: SmallGapBars;
  listOfAnimals = new Array(5);

  putAnimals() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

    }
  }
}

class HerbivorousCage {
  fruitsFeedingBowl: FruitFeedingBowl;

  woodenBars: WoodenBars;
  listOfAnimals = new Array(5);

  putAnimals() {
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      this.listOfAnimals.push('herbivorous animal' + i);
    }
  }
}

// Same way we will create other Cage designs...

// ‚úîÔ∏è Composite Class -  Classes that made upon several other classes. CarnivorousCage & HerbivorousCage
// are composite class because they are created with other classes.

// ‚úîÔ∏è Utility Class - FruitFeedingBowl, WoodenBars, IronBars etc - are utility classes.

/**
 PROBLEM WITH ABOVE CODE -

1. For each type of cages, we have to create new class.
2. Maximum code are common in both the classes, so this is code duplicate.
 */

// Lets try to understand Dependencies in this structure -

/**
 üí° First Understand what is High level and low level design -

 High Level -  They are generic, abstract and it may be contain several things in self.
 Low level - They are very specific and very details to one thing. It may be talk only one thing.

 Example -
 College - High level design
 Medical college - low level (specific to medical studies only)
 Eng College - low level

 Clothes -  High level
 Jacket - low level
 coats - low level
 */

// So in the above code - find out low level and high level -

/**
1. IFeedingBowl -  High level
2. IBars -  High level
3. FruitFeedingBowl -  Low level (specific to fruits only)
4. MeatFeedingBowl - Low level
5. HerbivorousCage -  High level
6. CarnivorousCage -  High level

interfaces -  High level (IBars, IFeedingBowl)
Implementations - Low level  (FruitFeedingBowl, MeatFeedingBowl, WoodenBars)
Class -  High level (HerbivorousCage, CarnivorousCage) -  It seems like specific but they are composite class.

CarnivorousCage depends on three classes MeatFeedingBowl, WaterFeedingBowl, IronBars and
they internally depends on other interfaces.

*/

// üëÄ Issue is here -

// High level modules or Classes are depends on Low level modules or details.

// ‚≠ê Dependency Inversion Principle ‚≠ê

/**
 1. High-level modules should NOT depend on low-level modules/details.
2.  Instead, they should depend on Abstractions (interfaces)

// How can we achieve dependency inversion - by üíâ Dependency Injection

// üíâ Dependency Injection

// This Cage class now depends on directly abstractions (interfaces) not the low level classes.

    this.bowl = bowl;
    this.bars = bars;

}

// Client will pass dependencies.
