# JavaScript Origins

In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days.
It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.

# Who is the father of HTML?

HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is a programming language whose first version was written/developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. He is also known as the father of HTML.

# Which is JavaScript latest version?

ECMAScript 2022 (ES13) is the 13th edition of the ECMAScript standard that preceded the current ECMAScript 2023 (ES14).

# Who is father of CSS?

Wium Lie, during his days at CERN (the birthplace of the Web) introduced the concept of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

# What is ECMA?

ECMA means European Computer Manufacturer's Association.

# What is the relationship between JavaScript and ECMAScript?

ECMAScript defines what a scripting language should look like, while JavaScript is an actual implementation of that specification. ECMAScript is a standard that all implementations of JavaScript must follow. Any browser or engine that implements JavaScript must adhere to this standard.

In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

EcmaScript specification tells how JavaScript should be implemented by the browser so that a JavaScript program runs exactly the same in all the browsers, but it does not tell how JavaScript should run inside these browsers.

# Do all browsers use the same JavaScript engine?

Each web browser uses a specific rendering engine to interpret the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a web page and display it on your screen. For instance, Google Chrome and Opera use the Blink engine, Firefox uses Gecko, and Safari uses WebKit.

# What is V8?

V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.
The V8 is the most popular javascript engine developed by Google for its Chrome browser. Along with Google Chrome, many other Chromium-based browsers use it. v8 engine parses and executes JavaScript code.

# Chrome uses Blink engine or v8 engine?

Blink is Google Chrome's rendering engine, V8 is the JavaScript Engine used within Blink, and Chromium is the browser project that holds them all together. 

# What is chromium?

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.
The Google Chrome browser is the better web browser for general internet use. If you're a developer, Chromium is a better resource for testing new features or creating a new browser.
Chromium is better for advanced users and web developers. It is a open source platform so web developers always choose this one.
