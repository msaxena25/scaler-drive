/* In a perfect binary tree, all the internal nodes have exactly two children. Every leaf node in a perfect binary tree must be present at the same level. A perfect binary tree is also called a strict binary tree. */

//A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which node insertion takes place from the left. Means Every node instead of last level should have 2 children. And If last level have children then it should be from left to right.
